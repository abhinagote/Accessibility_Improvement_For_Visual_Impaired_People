# 🔊 Accessibility Improvement for Visually Impaired People - CCNLP Mini Project  

## 📌 Introduction  
The **Accessibility Improvement for Visually Impaired People** project provides a seamless solution for converting digital text from PDFs, images, and text files into high-quality speech. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies, this tool enhances accessibility by enabling visually impaired individuals to consume text-based content effortlessly.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Multi-Format Support**: Extracts text from PDFs, images (JPEG, PNG), and text files.  
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Converts scanned text into editable text.  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Produces natural, high-quality voice output.  
- **Braille Conversion**: Provides an option to convert text into Braille format.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for visually impaired users with screen reader support.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Converts text to speech instantly for quick accessibility.  

## 🏗️ Technologies Used  
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR  
- **Text-to-Speech Engine**: Google Text-to-Speech (TTS), Pyttsx3 (Offline)  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, Pyttsx3, gTTS, pdfplumber  
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook  
- **User Interface**: High-contrast UI with accessibility features
